# Project README: Email Service With Golang


## Overview

This project implements a backend service in Golang that integrates with RabbitMQ to process incoming messages and send emails to users asynchronously. The application uses the asynchronous nature of Golang to efficiently handle message queues and email dispatching.
Features

    RabbitMQ Integration: The service is designed to consume messages from RabbitMQ queues, enabling seamless communication and decoupling between components.

    Asynchronous Processing: Leveraging Golang's concurrency features, the application processes messages asynchronously, allowing for efficient handling of multiple tasks concurrently.

    Email Notification: Upon receiving a message from RabbitMQ, the service composes and sends emails to the specified users. It supports customizable email templates and dynamic content.

# Getting Started
